INSTRUCTIONS

=== k-means Clustering SDP ==========================================================

Files are in "Clustering" folder.

1) Run "DownloadData" to download the implementation of k-means SDP [MVW2017] from 
Soledad Villar's github page <https://github.com/solevillar/kmeans_sdp/>. 
Please read the README files in the downloaded content. You are downloading this 
content on your will, and we do not accept responsibility for the use of this 
content. 

2) Run "TestHCGM" and "TestSHCGM". These scripts will run the test with the two 
optimization algorithms, homotopy conditional gradient method (HCGM) [YFLC2018] and 
the stochastic version SHCGM [LYFC2019], and save the results.

3) Run "PlotFig1" to generate Figure 1 in [LYFC2019].

=== Online Covariance Matrix Estimation =============================================

1) Run "TestCME". This script will run 6 tests with various methods and settings, 
and save the results.

2) Run "PlotFig2" and "PlotFig3" to generate Figures 2 and 3 in [LYFC2019].

=== Stochastic Matrix Completion ====================================================

1) Run "DownloadData". This will download the MovieLens 100k and 1m datasets [HK2016] 
and unzip them. Please read the README files in the downloaded content. You are 
downloading this content on your will, and we do not accept responsibility 
for the use of this content. 

2) Run "TestMovieLens100k". This will run the tests with SHCGM and Stochastic 
Frank-Wolfe method (SFW1) [MHK2018] with 100k dataset and save the results. 

3) Run "TestMovieLens1m". This will run the tests with SHCGM and Stochastic Three 
Composite Convex Minimization Method (S3CCM) [YVC2016] with 1m dataset and save the 
results.

4) Run "PlotFig4" and "PlotFig5" to generate Figures 4 and 5 in [LYFC2019].
